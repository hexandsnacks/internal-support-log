# Internal Support Log

A lightweight internal support logging tool built with Flask and SQLite.

Designed to simulate an internal office tool used for logging, reviewing, and managing support issues. The project emphasizes clean routing, data persistence, and UI behavior driven by application state rather than page reload hacks. Demonstrates Git rebase conflict resolution and clean commit history.

## Features

- Persistent storage using SQLite
- Server-side rendering with Flask
- Simple, readable UI for non-technical users
- Delete functionality for issue management
